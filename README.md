## <span style="color: #9677EF">_Overview and Origin_</span>

AI has made very significant impacts across many sectors of the healthcare space. It has revolutionized sectors such as Medical Diagnosis, Drug Delivery, Patient Experience, Healthcare Data Managment, and Robotic Surgery [[1]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-healthcare). AI is able to massively contribute to this area due to the huge amount of data available to develop models and train the AI. For example, in the medical diagnosis sector for screening for cancer, there are millions of images of cancerous cells that the AI can train on and then use that predict if a new image from a patient is at risk for cancer. The ability of AI to interpret such massive data sets of the cancerous cells contributes to its accuracy and in some cases can outperform radiologists in recognizing cancerous cells [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616181/).

    - Founded Nov 5, 2013 and went public on April 16, 2021

* __Founders__
    - Christopher Gibson, Blake Borgeson, Dean Li

* __Origin Story__
    - Chris, who is one of the founders, was pursuing his PhD in Dr. Dean Li's lab by working on a project where it was thought that a protein RhoA played a central role in cerebral cavernous malformation. When that hypothesis was tested, the data showed the exact opposite. Chris was astounded by the complexity of biology and that led him to integrate a technological approach to testing the effect of specific inputs to biological systems. In his lab, he used machine learning to screen thousands of images from microscopes of diseased and healthy cells that had drugs applied them. This AI was tested against humans, and the AI was able to more accurately detect if a drug had efficacy against diseased cells [[3]](https://www.bme.utah.edu/2023/07/21/an-interview-with-chris-gibson/). This led Chris to founding Recursion where the mission statement states: 

      >"Through technologies like automation, new biological tools, and artificial intelligence, we believe we can generate intelligent maps of biology and navigate those maps to more effective medicines."[[4]](https://www.recursion.com/our-story)

## <span style="color: #9677EF">_Business Activities_</span>

The company is trying to solve the problem of human bias in discovering drugs and evaluating efficacy. They specialize in efficiency in drug discovery which traditionally is taking longer and becoming more expensive.

Since this company is geared towards drug discovery and advancing promising solutions through the approval process, they partner with drug manufactuers to deliver the new drugs to the primary customers, the patients. The drug manufacturers that Recursion partners with can also be seen as a "customer" since they license out the rights to mass manufacture the drug to them. Overall, Recursion spearheads the development of novel drugs which, once they are approved for human use, can be licensed to pharma companies willing to mass produce that drug which can then be sold to the patients. Other customers can include companies who want to use the massive amount of high quality data that is generated by Recursion to conduct their own research, development, etc. They can sell or license the data as well to generate additional income. In terms of the market size, based on the revenue pulled in by pharma companies worldwide, it amounts to 1.48 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022 [[6]](https://www.statista.com/topics/1764/global-pharmaceutical-industry/#:~:text=The%20pharmaceutical%20industry%20is%20responsible,trillion%20U.S.%20dollars%20in%202022).

One of the reasons they have an advantage in this space is because they have access and have accumulated a bigger data set to train their ML AI to discover the best candidates for drugs to treat specific diseases. They have the highest quality, fit for purpose data which is then used to train the AI/ML to recognize cellular data. The volume of cell data they generate is more than any other competitor [[[7],8:00]](https://www.recursion.com/download-day). They are also the pioneers in integrating all the "point solutions", meaning solutions in a specific step in the drug development process, into a full workflow that optimizes the overall drug delivery process to be more efficient. They also have the most capable supercomputer in the entire industry after partnering with NVIDIA [[[7],12:50]](https://www.recursion.com/download-day).

The main technology they are using is called the the Recursion Operating System. It is a platform that uses the largest proprietary biological and chemical datasets (more than 50 petabytes) that they generate in house. It is a mapping and navigating technology. The maps are built using image based, high dimensional data that they generate by performing 2.2 million experiments in their automated wet labs every week to capture cellular responses to various chemical compounds. They start with a specific disease and then conduct gene knockouts. Then they image the the cells from the microscope and pass that data through the ML AI and it shows the genes associated with that disease. Then they look at existing pharmaceutical drugs and what genes they impact and associated to the genes of the disease. They then also draw associations for all of the chemicals in their database that also have strong connections to the disease genes. So it basically shows a list of chemicals that could also be effective against the disease causing genes. They claim to have over 3 trillion relationships in their maps of biology. This map contains associations between disease and genes, pairs of genes, and genes and compounds [[8]](https://www.recursion.com/technology).

## <span style="color: #9677EF">_Landscape_</span>

This company is in the healthcare/pharmaceuticals space. This space has experience many revolutions due to AI involvement. 

One specific area that AI is transforming is the drug discovery process. Before the use of AI, scientists would have to conduct extensive research on the associations between genes and the disease. Then they would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to research the chemical compounds and their efficacy on the disease. Then they would have to spend even more to conduct robust and convincing clincial trials to get the drug approved for industrial manufacture and wide spread distribution. According to Recursion:
>"Historically, it has taken over ten years and an average capitalized R&D cost of approximately $2 billion per approved medicine to move a drug discovery project from early discovery to an approved therapeutic." [[4]](https://www.recursion.com/our-story)

 With their technology that uses AI, Recursion is able to generate novel starting points for compounds in weeks with only thousands of dollars [[[7],52:00]](https://www.recursion.com/download-day). AI is now able to expedite this entire process by being able to draw the associations between many more genes and the disease than what a human can do and do it much faster and with better accuracy. It then also draws associations between many different chemical compounds and its efficacy on the disease. Not only can AI recommend what compounds are most likely to be effective but it can actually optimize the synthesis pathway of the compound and suggest improvements to increase manfucaturability [[9]](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2023/03/20/how-artificial-intelligence-is-revolutionizing-drug-discovery/). It can even design clinical trials with real patients to produce the most convincing case for the most effective drug to treat the disease. All of this AI technology together produces more effective drugs and gets them into the hands of patients much faster than the traditional route. 

AI is also being used to solve the difficult problem of protein folding. This is important to drug discovery because the genes produce proteins that generate the disease or are tied to it. Therefore, knowing its structure is an important part in determining which compounds have the best chances of interfering or influencing these proteins. AI uses machine learning to identify the patterns between 3D structures of proteins and the amino acid sequence that generated them. It has the ability to crunch millions of pairs of the linear amino acid sequence and its resulting 3D structure to then predict the structure given any linear sequence [[10]](https://www.gene.com/stories/redefining-drug-discovery-with-ai). AI can then also be used to simulate the interaction of these proteins with drugs, reducing the need of real bench top experiments. 

The use of AI is dramatically increasing the appeal of this field. This is evident by the number of investors doubling annually over the past five years, pouring in more than 5 billion dollars at the end of 2021 [[9]](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2023/03/20/how-artificial-intelligence-is-revolutionizing-drug-discovery/).

The major players in the drug development space that are leveraging AI in the drug development process include:

* Schrödinger
* Insitro
* AbCellera
* Relay Therapeutics
* Atomwise
* Recursion Pharmaceuticals
* XtalPi
* ExScientia

All these companies use the same approach of using AI to correlate compounds to the efficacy of reducing or curing a disease. All of them have multiple drugs in the pipeline to treat a particular diseases.

## <span style="color: #9677EF">_Results_</span>

Recursion has a wide impact on the therapeutics space over the past 10 years. It has made progress in areas including rare diseases and oncology. Specifically it has drugs that are currently in phase 2 clinical trials for treating Cerebral Cavernous Malformation, Neurofibromatosis Type 2, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, and Advanced AXIN1 or APC Mutant Cancers. There are also drugs in other earlier phases for treating Fibrotic Disease, Clostridioides Difficile Infection, and advanced HR-Proficient Ovarian Cancers. Furthermore, it has over 50 petabytes of biological, chemical and patient data. This enables them and their partners (Roche/Genentech, Bayer) to access high quality data to use ML to substantially narrow the search for effective drugs against diseases like predicting drug candidates for COVID-19. They are also generating interest by involving companies that produce computer hardware like NVIDIA.They recently partnered with NVIDIA to upgrade their ML capabilities significantly to produce the most powerful supercomputer used in the pharma space so far [[11]](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/drug-discovery-recursion-supercomputer/). This is important because companies like Recursion that use computationally intensive technologies as a vital part of their business model require better and more efficient hardware. All of these involvements and impacts are leading to significantly reducing the failure rate of drug testing and dramatically reducing the overall cost of drug development.

Recursion is also contributing to the development of regulations required by the FDA to oversee the use of this new AI technology in the drug development process. They are doing this by supporting the FDA in answering key questions for how they will oversee this new space [[12]](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/604197abb43603652c167bfa/64f22714abe5e50b2e0d934c_Recursion%20Comments_FDA-2023-N-0743.pdf). They have provided feedback on many questions including:
* Where regulatory clarity is needed
* What does transparency mean in AI/ML and what are the main barriers
* How are humans involved in the AI/ML drug development process
* How is the process traceable and auditable
* How is the data quality controlled
* How is privacy and security maintained 

In this drug development space, the main metric is how many drugs they have that are either approved by the FDA or are on their way to being approved. Based on these metrics, the company is doing quite well compared to the competitors due to its use of AI technology and partnering with NVIDIA to build a powerful supercomputer:

## <span style="color: #9677EF">_Recommendations_</span>

The process of drug development is highly dependent on which disease the process is focused onl. Therefore, one possible improvement to the business is to use AI to output the disease with the highest impact. This is because the company already have licensing models for their drugs and a huge amount of data to actually develop the drug for a disease. However, the improvement that they can make to their process is to use AI to first identifiy the diseases with the biggest impact to the population and what the target price of the drug can be based on if they sell it themselves or license it out.

This improvement would focus on the "disease" side of the business more. Depending on the inputs to the AI and which factors are weighed heavier than others, diseases with the biggest impact would be recommended and then they can use their current system to develop a drug for it [[8]](https://www.recursion.com/technology). This would theoretically increase the company's reputation by treating the most recognizable diseases to the general population. This would cause an increased interest in the company raising its stock price and attracting investors or even drug manufacturing companies to mass produce the drug.

This improvement would leverage AI in analyzing many sectors of data for the diseases. AI would be used to take a disease as an input and then the neural network would have many inputs such as severity of the disease [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01173-x), cases per year [[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266644962400015X), population/countries that are effected [[23]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9885935/#:~:text=AI%20can%20also%20help%20to,features%20%5B5%2C%206%5D.), reoccurence rates, how often the disease shows up in the news [[24]](https://snorkel.ai/news-analytics/), research papers [[25]](https://elicit.com/), etc. It would analyze all this data and output the "impact score" of the disease. After passing in all known disease, the AI would output a list of the highest impact diseases and then the company would know which ones are most worth pursuing. 

AI and ML is appropriate for this recommendation because many associations must be made between many different inputs as mentioned above. There are multiple factors to consider and the more factors that are considered the possible combinations of between factors increases exponentially. This is highly computationally intensive and so a quantum neural network [[26]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14454-2) structure is the best way to analyze such a large number of factors paired with ample computing power provided by the best computer hardware companies [[27]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Top-AI-hardware-companies). This would allow for company resources to be spent treating diseases that will both serve the most patients while increasing the company's reputation and profitability simultaneously.
